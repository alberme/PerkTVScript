# PerkTVScript

PerkTVScript is used to automate watching videos in the Perk TV app. This script will start the Perk TV app, tap through the various screens, play videos, terminate the app after 5 minutes, and repeat the process. The termination is to prevent any automation checks or frozen ads.

This script only works on a jailbroken iDevice with the AutoTouch tweak installed. Only versions 3.5.3-8 and 2.0.2 are supported at the moment.

Simply download the version that corresponds to your AutoTouch install, ensure you have the Perk TV app installed, and run the script.

Use in conjunction with the tweak called FastFoward for faster playing videos.
